# HIsomap

This is a Python implementation of homology-preserving dimension reduction(DR) algorithm. The implementation is described in ["Homology-Preserving Dimensionality Reduction via Manifold Landmarking and Tearing"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08460.pdf).

There is also a [demo](https://github.com/LynneYan/HomologyDR_Tearing) for both homology-preserving manifold landmarking and tearing.

## How to use:

Tested with Python 2.7&3.7, MacOS and Linux.

## Install

### Dependencies

HIsomap requires:

  - Python (>= 2.7 or >= 3.3)
  - NumPy
